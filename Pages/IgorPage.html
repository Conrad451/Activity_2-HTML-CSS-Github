                    Igor, released on May 17, 2019, is the fifth studio album by Tyler, the Creator.
                    Entirely produced by Tyler, the album features guest appearances from artists like Playboi Carti, Lil Uzi Vert, Solange, Kanye West, and Jerrod Carmichae. 
                   The album blends hip hop, neo soul, R&B, and funk, and follows a narrative centered on a love triangle involving the titular character, Igor. 
                   Igor debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and won Best Rap Album at the 2020 Grammy Awards.
                   The album’s standout single, “Earfquake,” became Tyler’s highest-charting single.
