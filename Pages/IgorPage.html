                    Igor, released on May 17, 2019, is the fifth studio album by Tyler, the Creator.<br>
                     Entirely produced by Tyler, the album features guest appearances from artists like Playboi Carti, Lil Uzi Vert, Solange, Kanye West, and Jerrod Carmichae. <br>
                    The album blends hip hop, neo soul, R&B, and funk, and follows a narrative centered on a love triangle involving the titular character, Igor. <br>
                    Igor debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and won Best Rap Album at the 2020 Grammy Awards.<br>
                    The album’s standout single, “Earfquake,” became Tyler’s highest-charting single.
