                <h1>Short n' Sweet</h1>
                <h3>by Sabrina Carpenter</h3>
                <h5>
                    “Short n’ Sweet” is the sixth studio album by American singer Sabrina Carpenter, released on August 23, 2024. The album features a blend of pop with influences from country, rock, disco, and R&B. It was produced by notable names like Julian Bunetta, John Ryan, Ian Kirkpatrick, and Jack Antonoff.
                    The album’s title reflects both the emotional impact of Carpenter’s brief romantic relationships and her short stature. It explores themes of love and dating in the 2020s, showcasing Carpenter’s growth and creative control over her music.
                    “Short n’ Sweet” was preceded by two successful singles, “Espresso” and “Please Please Please,” both of which topped the Billboard Global 200 chart. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, marking Carpenter’s first album to achieve this feat.
